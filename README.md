Slides, code, and images for a presentation on perceptual hashes I gave in May 2012.

Slides are provided as LaTeX source. For a pre-built PDF, look at the [Downloads](https://github.com/Cairnarvon/phash-presentation/downloads). (Warning: they're also in Dutch.)

`histogram.py`, `avghash.py`, and `dct.py` implement the three methods discussed. You will need the [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/) (likely also available through your package manager). Run the scripts without arguments. They return a list of matches (closest match first) along with the scores.

The images were selected from around the Interwebs. If I've used one of yours and you'd like me not to, let me know.
